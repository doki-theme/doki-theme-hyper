## Installation

[You'll need hyper first!](https://hyper.is/#installation).
After you have hyper, you will need to make sure that hyper is in your path (you can find that in the plugins menu). Then all you need to run is

```
hyper i doki-theme-hyper
```

Be sure to restart hyper afterwards.

## Configuration

![Theme Usage](./screenshots/gifs/hyper_usage.gif)

In the hamburger menu (Linux/Windows) or settings bar (MacoOS) there is a `Doki-Theme 
Settings` option with various options:

- **Themes**: Contains all of themes you can decorate your Hyper.js term with.
- **Sticker Type**: Some themes have more than one sticker associated with the theme. This enables you to switch between the two.
- **Toggle Sticker**: This shows or hides the theme's sticker. It is defaulted to being on.
- **Toggle Fonts**: The current font family for the Doki-Theme is `Victor Mono`, this is a convenience option to apply that font family for you.
- **About Plugin**: Gives you the current version of the plugin.
- **View Changelog**: Opens your default browser to the changelog of Doki-Theme for Hyper.js.

### Suggestive Content

<div align="center">
    <img src="https://doki.assets.unthrottled.io/misc/suggestive/cultured.gif" ></img>
</div>

So I thought it was a good idea to add a bit of culture to this plugin.
<sup><sup>Ya boi is horny on main.</sup></sup>

I will give you a bit of a warning before you install suggestive content.
Some of us are professional Otaku, who want to remain, well...professional.
Don't worry if you choose to continue, I won't ask you again for that specific theme.

Applies for the following content:

- Rias Onyx: Secondary Content


### Configuration

If you want to be able to configure the opacity of the wallpaper used by your current theme(s), please add this to your hyper config.

```js
  dokiSettings: {
    backgrounds: {
      dark: {
        opacity: 0.2 // default is 0.10
      },
      light: {
        opacity: 0.4 // default is 0.15
      }
    }
  }
```

**Customizing CSS**

If you feel the need to slightly change your current theme's styles, you can add your valid CSS in the `css` property in the config file.

[This should give you an idea of the styles that need to be overridden.](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-hyper/blob/be29451f076e5904ad25b4d0639fe4d171292ea3/src/css.ts#L54)

[You can find your hyper config here](https://hyper.is/#cfg)
